# gutenberg-cantabile
I present here a microservice-oriented application that is a Reactive version of the previous project [gutenberg-allegro](https://github.com/dubersfeld/gutenberg-allegro). This project uses an Elasticsearch Docker image instead of the local Elasticsearch service that should be stopped to avoid any port conflict. In addition I have implemented some basic test classes for the four backend servers.
